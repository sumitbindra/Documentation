Software and Implementation
=============================

This chapter details the software, hardware, and implementation aspects of the Metro Vancouver ABM.

Modeling Software and Platform
--------------------------------

The ABM is implemented using [Specify Software, e.g., CT-RAMP, DaySim, or custom platform], a robust and widely-used platform for activity-based modeling. This section describes the key features and functionalities of the chosen software.

Hardware Requirements
-----------------------

Running the ABM requires significant computational resources. This section outlines the minimum and recommended hardware specifications, including processor speed, RAM, and storage capacity.

Model Run Times
-----------------

Typical run times for the ABM vary depending on the scenario complexity and hardware. This section provides estimates for different types of model runs (e.g., base year, forecast year, policy scenarios).

Directory Structure and Key Scripts
-------------------------------------

The model's files are organized in a specific directory structure to facilitate efficient execution and management. Key scripts automate various tasks, including data preparation, model execution, and output processing.
