Introduction
=============

This chapter provides an overview of the Activity-Based Model (ABM) for the Metro Vancouver region.

Purpose and Scope
-------------------

The primary purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ABM, its components, and its application in transportation planning for the Metro Vancouver area. The scope includes the model's theoretical underpinnings, data inputs, core modules, outputs, and validation processes.

Overview of ABM Approach
--------------------------

Activity-Based Models represent a significant advancement over traditional trip-based models by simulating the daily activity and travel patterns of individuals and households. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of travel behavior and its response to policy changes.

Modeling Area
---------------

The Metro Vancouver ABM covers the entire Metro Vancouver regional district, encompassing all municipalities and electoral areas within its boundaries. The model's geographic resolution is based on a detailed transportation analysis zone (TAZ) system.

History and Evolution
-----------------------

The development of the Metro Vancouver ABM has been an iterative process, building upon previous modeling efforts and incorporating new data sources and methodological advancements. This section details the key milestones in its evolution.
