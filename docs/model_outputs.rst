This chapter describes the various outputs generated by the Metro Vancouver ABM and their interpretation.

Key Output Files
------------------

The model produces a variety of output files, including detailed trip lists, activity schedules, and aggregated summaries. These files are typically in CSV or other standard formats for further analysis.

Trip Tables
-------------

Aggregated trip tables provide origin-destination flows by purpose, mode, and time of day, offering insights into travel demand patterns.

Network Performance Metrics
-----------------------------

Outputs include key performance indicators such as Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), Vehicle Hours Traveled (VHT), average speeds, and congestion levels on the road network.

Accessibility Measures
------------------------

The model can generate various accessibility measures, indicating the ease with which individuals can reach opportunities (e.g., jobs, schools) by different modes of transportation.

Equity Analysis Outputs
-------------------------

Outputs can be disaggregated by demographic groups to assess the distributional impacts of transportation policies on different segments of the population, supporting equity analyses.
