Model Calibration and Validation
===================================

This chapter outlines the processes of calibrating and validating the Metro Vancouver ABM.

Calibration Strategy
---------------------

Calibration involves adjusting model parameters to ensure that the model outputs align with observed travel behavior and system performance. This is an iterative process involving sensitivity testing and parameter adjustments.

Validation Against Observed Data
----------------------------------

Model validation assesses the model's ability to reproduce independent observed data, such as screenline counts, transit ridership, and travel time surveys. Statistical tests and visual comparisons are used to evaluate model fit.

Sensitivity and Reasonableness Testing
---------------------------------------

Beyond calibration and validation, the model undergoes sensitivity testing to understand its response to changes in key input variables. Reasonableness checks ensure that model outputs are consistent with expert judgment and theoretical expectations.
