Model Theoretical Framework
===========================

This chapter details the theoretical framework underpinning the Metro Vancouver ABM.

Core Concepts
---------------

The ABM is built upon the premise that travel is derived from the need to participate in activities. Key concepts include activity chains, tours, and episodes, which collectively describe an individual's daily schedule.

Behavioral Assumptions
-----------------------

The model incorporates various behavioral assumptions, such as utility maximization, bounded rationality, and habit formation, to simulate realistic travel choices. These assumptions are informed by extensive travel behavior research.

Model Structure Overview
------------------------

The ABM operates as a sequence of interconnected modules, each simulating a specific aspect of daily activity and travel behavior. A high-level flowchart illustrates the data flow and decision points within the model system.

Differences from Trip-Based Models
-----------------------------------

Unlike trip-based models that focus on individual trips, the ABM simulates entire daily activity patterns, capturing interdependencies between trips and activities. This allows for a more accurate assessment of policy impacts on travel demand.
