Core Model Components
=======================

This chapter details the core modules and decision processes within the Metro Vancouver ABM.

Long-Term Choice Models
-------------------------

These models simulate long-term decisions such as usual workplace and school location choices, which influence daily activity patterns.

Daily Activity and Travel Pattern Models
-----------------------------------------

These modules generate daily activity patterns for each synthetic individual, including the type, duration, and sequence of activities, and the tours associated with them.

Tour-Level Choice Models
-------------------------

For each tour, models determine the primary destination, time of day for travel, and chosen mode of transportation (e.g., auto, transit, active modes).

Trip-Level Choice Models
-------------------------

Within tours, these models simulate intermediate stops, including their generation, location, and purpose, capturing complex travel behaviors.

Network Assignment
-------------------

Finally, simulated trips are assigned to the transportation networks (highway and transit) to determine travel times, congestion, and network performance.
